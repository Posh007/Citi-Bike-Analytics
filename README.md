# Tableau - Citi Bike Analytics

## Overview

Citi bike is the largest bike sharing program in the United States that is continuasly seeking to publicize and improve its city program.  Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process.  A data visualization project using Tableau has been undertaken to help publicize and share information about the New York Citi Bike program using January to December 2020 data from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.
